#### Backend deployed at [heroku](https://sauti-africa-market-master.herokuapp.com/) <br> <br> View the API Docs & Examples at [Postman](https://price-api.sautiafrica.org/docs

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm i** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm run test** to start server using testing environment
- **install redis** to allow API Keys to be processed. Please install redis from [here](https://redis.io/)
- Acquire the correct .env file to ensure proper operation
- Acquire API key and pass it as header to any available routes of developer route. Consult API Docs on Postman(see above)

### NodeJS/Express Server

- We chose Node.js/Express because we were familiar with the tech and could leverage the use of middleware.
- We chose knex as our query builder because we were familiar with it and were able to build the appropriate queries very quickly.
- Custom Validation Middleware to ensure query parameters are received correctly and throw meaningful errors.

## Endpoints

#### Developer Route

- Access Control: Access of these endpoints given to developers through API keys.
- All endpoints make use of query strings
